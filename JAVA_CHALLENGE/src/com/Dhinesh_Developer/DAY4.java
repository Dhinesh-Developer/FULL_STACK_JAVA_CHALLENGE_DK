 *  MAIN METHOD
 *   	os gives the control of execution to the main method 
 *   the main should present inside the class.
 *   System.out(stream) is called as pipe.
 *   
 *   println for new line   and the  print for same line.
 *   
 *   public -> to visible, for main is present.identify by os.
 *   static -> no need to create a object for class.
 *   void ->  no return statement.
 *   
 *   to compile in cmd.
 *   stage 1. javac Demo.java  -> to compile high level to byte code . (compiler) does this part.
 *   stage 2. javac Demo -> to to convert byte code to machine level code. (JVM) does this part
 *   
 *   System.out.println(args[o]); we can pass the arguments to main methods.while executing.
 *   
 *   valid syntax:
 *   	-> public static void main(String...args);
 *   	-> static public void main(String[] args);
